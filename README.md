### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---

The name is Gideoni. I'm from Brazil. My passion for coding started at the age of 15 (that was some time ago). I started creating websites with some very simple HTML code. I also learned a little bit of other programming lannguages at the time. I created a simple game with some very good logics too. It was very fun. Now, many years later, I started coding again. Things have changed a bit, but it's never too late to catch up. 

I'm an English teacher which means it's needless to say I love working with people =). I love teaching and helping people. I love team work and tackling on problems. 

---

I've been a little more focused on frontend stuff like Reactjs, CSS and HTML.
